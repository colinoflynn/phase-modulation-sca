# Phase Moducation Side Channel Analysis and JTAG Attacks

This repository is a companion for the T-CHES paper "Phase Modulation Side Channels: Jittery JTAG for On-Chip Voltage Measurements". You can see a copy of it on the E-Print server (NB: not yet here... standby).

This repository is still being updated & will shortly have more complete information included.
